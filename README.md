### About me

My enthusiasm lies within the realm of Data Science, built upon a solid base of mathematics, economics, and machine learning. At present, I am studying an MSc. in Statistics and have graduated from studying a BSc. in Economics and Mathematics. Personally, I enjoy utilising and leveraging data-driven solutions in order to solve complex problems, and telling stories through data.

### Projects

**Predicting Train Delays to Nottingham Station**
*	Co - developed a predictive Random Forest model in R capable of providing accurate estimations of train delays. This model facilitated the management of train schedules, staffing, and infrastructure maintenance in Nottingham to minimise delays

**Diagnosis of heart conditions from ECG data, via Random Forest (RF) Classification**
* Utilised Random Forest in R to accurately diagnose heart conditions from ECG data, leveraging RF for precise medical diagnostics. As a team, engineered model which reduced diagnostic turnaround time, enhancing patient care in clinical settings.Developed efficient workflow integrating data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training on patient ECG data

**An Exploration into Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with comparisons to other Classification Methods** | Grade: 85% 
* Rigorously evaluated SVMs against various classification techniques through comprehensive experimentation and benchmarking. Explored mathematical foundations of SVMs, performing analysis in Python, comparing SVM with other classification methods
